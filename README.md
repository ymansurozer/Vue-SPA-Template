## Why?

This template is heavily inspired by [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse). But, for my SaaS projects, I needed an SPA version with Tailwind CSS + Headless UI (along with related plugins and configurations). And most importantly, I had to build this template from the ground up to understand how Vitesse worked so well and how I can extend it for my needs in the future.
